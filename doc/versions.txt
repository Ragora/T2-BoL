Versioning scheme goes as such:

Major.Minor.Revision
Changes in the major portion means that any client/servers that do not have matching major versions
will immediately be determined as incompatible and will be asked to upgrade (or downgrade in some events)

Changes in minor are generally feature implementations that do not affect overall compatability between newer
and older versions of the modification.

Changes in revision indicate quick bugfixes that are released as small patches for the modification rather
than an entirely new download.
