Intelligence - Determines how well you operate with sophisicated entities such as computer systems

Strength - Determines how much you may attempt to carry on you in any given moment.

Dexterity - Determines how well you can work with your hands. Affects the quality of produces items
and how long it may take to produce said items. Could possibly work in conjunction with intelligence
(perhaps for forming sophisicated items -- computer parts used in bots?)
